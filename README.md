# What this is all about

I once downloaded a zip file containing multiple files and folders, many of the file and folder names contained the name of the distributor and it made the files look cluttered and I wanted to clean it up. But there were simply too many files and subfolders that needed to be changed, so I wrote a python script instead!

# Usage
Clone the repository
cd into the folder
open the python script and change the watermark string to whatever substring you want to remove from the filenames
run the script in the root folder of your files (don't run it the actual root directory of your system!)
